How to run the program:

1) change initial state in the python file to desired matrix.

2) change for loop range value to desired number of generations of children  for BFS

3) [[x, child1, child2, ..., y]]  ,   this is the visited list that shows the postion of zero/blank in a state.
                                      y is the parent and x is the parent from layer above or where y came from.
